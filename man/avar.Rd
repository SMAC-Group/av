avar(x, type = "mo")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{vec} containing the time series under observation.}

\item{type}{A \code{string} containing either \code{"mo"} for Maximal Overlap or \code{"to"} for Tau Overlap}
}
\value{
av   A \code{list} that contains:
\itemize{
 \item{"clusters"}{The size of the cluster}
 \item{"allan"}{The Allan variance}

}

\description{
Computes the Allan Variance
}
\details{
The decomposition and the amount of time it takes to perform it depends on whether you are using
the Tau Overlap or the Maximal Overlap.

\section{Maximal Overlap Allan Variance}{

Given \eqn{N} equally spaced samples with averaging time \eqn{\tau = n\tau _0}{tau = n*tau_0},
where \eqn{n} is an integer such that \eqn{ 1 \le n \le \frac{N}{2}}{1<= n <= N/2}.
Therefore, \eqn{n} is able to be selected from \eqn{\left\{ {n|n < \left\lfloor {{{\log }_2}\left( N \right)} \right\rfloor } \right\}}{{n | n < floor(log2(N))}}
Then, \eqn{M = N - 2n} samples exist.
The Maximal-overlap estimator is given by:
\deqn{\frac{1}{{2\left( {N - 2k + 1} \right)}}\sum\limits_{t = 2k}^N {{{\left[ {{{\bar Y}_t}\left( k \right) - {{\bar Y}_{t - k}}\left( k \right)} \right]}^2}} }{See PDF Manual}

where \deqn{ {{\bar y}_t}\left( \tau  \right) = \frac{1}{\tau }\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{\tau  - 1} {{{\bar y}_{t - i}}} }{See PDF Manual}.
}

\section{Tau-Overlap Allan Variance}{

Given \eqn{N} equally spaced samples with averaging time \eqn{\tau = n\tau _0}{tau = n*tau_0},
where \eqn{n} is an integer such that \eqn{ 1 \le n \le \frac{N}{2}}{1<= n <= N/2}.
Therefore, \eqn{n} is able to be selected from \eqn{\left\{ {n|n < \left\lfloor {{{\log }_2}\left( N \right)} \right\rfloor } \right\}}{{n | n < floor(log2(N))}}
Then, a sampling of \eqn{m = \left\lfloor {\frac{{N - 1}}{n}} \right\rfloor  - 1} samples exist.
The tau-overlap estimator is given by:

where \eqn{ {{\bar y}_t}\left( \tau  \right) = \frac{1}{\tau }\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{\tau  - 1} {{{\bar y}_{t - i}}} }{See PDF Manual}.

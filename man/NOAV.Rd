\title{Non-stationary Non-overlapping Allan Variance}
\usage{
NOAV(n, covmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A \code{integer} indicating the length of each vector of consecutive observations considered for the average.}

\item{covmat}{A \code{matrix} indicating the T-by-T covariance matrix of the time series with length T.}
}
\value{
A \code{field<numeric>} that is the theoritical Non-overlapping Allan Variance for constant-mean non-stationary time series data
}
\description{
Calculation of the theoritical Non-overlapping Allan Variance for constant-mean non-stationary time series data
}
\details{
Calculate Non-overlapping Allan Variance based on the defination on "Xu, Haotian, et al. "A Study of the Allan Variance for Constant-Mean Non-Stationary Processes." arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.07795 (2017)".
n is an integer larger than 1 and smaller than \eqn{floor\left(log_2 \left(dim\left(covmat\right)[1]\right)\right)-1}{floor(log2(dim(T)[1]))-1}
}
